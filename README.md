# MBTI Personality Test

## Overview

This JavaScript script is designed to create a personality test based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The MBTI is a psychological tool that categorizes individuals into one of sixteen personality types based on four dimensions (Extraversion/Introversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, Judging/Perceiving).

## Features

- **User Login:** The script initiates with a user login interface where users are prompted to enter their name and age.

- **Personality Test:** The main functionality of the script involves a series of questions for each of the four MBTI dimensions. Users choose between two options for each question, accumulating scores based on their selections.

- **Result Analysis:** After completing the test, the script calculates the scores for each dimension and determines the user's MBTI personality type.

- **Result Display:** The final result, along with additional information about the personality type, is displayed to the user. This includes a general description, detailed information, and suitable professions.

- **History Tracking:** The script keeps track of the user's test history, storing the results for future reference.
